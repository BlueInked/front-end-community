## WWCDC Front End First Timer's Guide - The Javascript Edition

This study guide is for people who are comfortable with HTML/CSS and are looking for a really short introduction to Javascript. This particular guide is meant to help users learn and understand how to take some of the many concepts that are taught in Javascript and actually integrate them with HTML/CSS to make certain elements of a page responsive. First off a review:

### What is Front End?

The "front end" is the part of the website or web application that a person can visually see and interact with. It is on the "front" of an application. Its main purpose is to interact with the user, as well as present the data in a well-defined style and structure. The front end is made up of two aspects:

* Design - aesthetics of the website or application, arrangement of elements on the screen, color, and font choices

* Front end web development (or "client-side" development) - elements that the user sees and interacts with directly. This aspect involves programming skills, primarily **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** but certainly not limited to them.

### What is Front End Development?

The focus of this study group is **Front End Development**. Though we appreciate designers joining and sharing their wisdom, the purpose of this group is to learn and encourage everyone to code.

A front end developer is the bridge that connects the designer and the back end developer. While a web designer creates the visual design and layout of the website, the web developer transforms a static design into a fully functioning website online and available to the world. By contrast, a back-end developer builds the underderlying architecture and functionality of the application (underneath the front end).

Almost all the elements that you see and interact with on any website are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interpretation of these elements is controlled by the browser. In other words, whether you use Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, the browser transforms all of the code into a website or application you can see and interact with. This includes but is not limited to fonts, colors, drop down menus, images, and forms.

### What tools do I need?

* A computer: Front end development is not restricted by operating system. You can learn front end development on Windows, Mac, and Linux (even Chrome OS!) machines.

* A text editor: you should not code using a regular word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word). While you can use Notepad or TextEdit, it's easier to code with user-friendly text editors with syntax highlighting. We recommend:
  * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Mac, Windows, Linux
  * [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) - Mac only
  * [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows only

* Git and GitHub: Version control is an important part of any professional developer's toolkit. These tools back up your work, facilitate collaboration, and manage changes through versioning. First [install Git](http://git.huit.harvard.edu/guide/) on your computer, then create an account on [Github](https://github.com). For an introduction to Git and Github, refer to the [Intro to Git presentation](http://nupurkapoor.github.io/intro-to-git/#/)

* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/): An online custom environment to test your HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can save the fiddles you create and share them with others. Check out the [official documentation](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html).

* Dedication, patience and support from each other!

### Basics

Note: though many technologies and programming languages contribute to web development, we will only be discussing the languages our group focuses on.

*Content, presentation, and behavior* are the three layers of the web.

![web-layers](http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1409729756css_three-layers.png)

#### 1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
HTML is the markup language of the web, used to structure a website's content so that the browser may read and display it. Markup consists of the structure and layout of a page's content. It is the foundation of a website and is vital to search engine optimization (SEO). A markup language specifies code for formatting content within a text file. The pieces of code used to specify the formatting are called tags.

HTML defines the `content layer` of a web page. It contains a website's information and content, including its structure and semantics. Text makes up most of the content on the web. Nevertheless, images, animations, sound, video, and whatever else an author wants to publish are also considered content.

The extension for an HTML file is **.html**

#### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
CSS defines the look and feel of the markup generated by HTML, including colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layouts, and grids. A single CSS change can affect the entire mood and tone of a Web site. The term *style sheet* refers to the CSS document itself. A web page can have one or multiple style sheets.

CSS makes up the `presentation layer` and defines how content will appear when someone accesses a page. The conventional way to view a web page is with a regular web browser, but that’s only one of many possible access methods (e.g. mobile devices, kiosks, etc.).

The extension for a CSS file is **.css**

*HTML and CSS are the building blocks of web development. Every web page is written in HTML. It’s important to know these two languages really well. Together they form the bare bones of a web page, so being able to write custom HTML and CSS is an extremely important skill. It's also important to understand how these two technologies work together: HTML sets the structure of the page and CSS styles the way it looks.*

#### 3. Javascript (JS)

JavaScript is the third and final pillar of modern web development (the other two being HTML and CSS). JavaScript is the most advanced language of all three. It enables us to interact with users via sliders, drop-down menus, quizzes, and many more interactive elements. It is what makes the modern web interactive, animated, and vibrant.

JavaScript constitutes the `behavior layer` - real-time user interaction. This can range from trivial validation of a required field in an email subscription form to a sophisticated web application that acts like an ordinary desktop program.

When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do the "magic" with it. Also, JavaScript is *NOT* the same as Java. Their names may be similar (purely for marketing reasons), but they are two completely different programming languages.

The extension for a JavaScript file is **.js**

*While it’s possible to embed all three layers within the same document, keeping them separate gives us one valuable advantage: we can modify or replace any of the layers without having to change the others.*

### Javascript (The Basics)

First off, the main difference between Javascript and HTML/CSS is that Javascript is considered a programming language while HTML/CSS is considered a mark-up langauge. Programming languages use logic to get things to function in a certain way often times based on the behavior of the user, where as HTML/CSS is used to section off, design and declare certain elements of a page.

For this guide, We are going to show you how to attach or add Javascript to an HTML/CSS page in order to make two things happen. First, get a button to reveal text when clicked, second get an alert box to pop up and third log a message to the Javascript console (more on this later).  

#### Practice - Making a button work

Let's get started. First, lets set up your HTML/CSS file. Open up your text editor, open a new page and save it as starterpage.html preferably in a folder that will contain files for this project only. Enter the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
After this open another page and save it as "starterpage.css" and then create a third page and save it as "starterpage.js" all in the same folder.

The third file is called an external javascript file and is used in a similar fashion to an external  stylesheet. In the HTML file, add a title, the utf type, the css src and the js src to the HTML file:

```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Using Javascript</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="starterpage.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>My Javascript Page</h1>
  <script src="starterpage.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
```

Because javascript needs to be bound to html elements in order to be visible on the page, unlike the css src, the js src is added to the bottom of the body (instead of the head) in order to make sure the html and css of the page are loaded first.


Next add the following to your html sheet: A heading, a button with and id, and a div with an id and a paragraph inside it. Then open it in your browser to see what the page looks like. An example is below.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Using Javascript</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="starterpage.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>My Javascript Page</h1>
    <button id="reveal">Show the text</button>
    <div id="text">
      <p>This is some information I want to pop up after I click the button</p>
    </div>
  <script src="starterpage.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's it for the HTML page. Now let's move on to the css page. In order to make sure the css src is working (and also make the page a little less bland), lets add a style rule that changes the color of the page.

```
body{
  background-color: lightgrey;
}

```

Then refresh the page in your browser to see the change. Working? great. now add a style rule for the div that contains you text and change the display to none.

```
body{
  background-color: lightgrey;
}

#text{
  display:none;
}

```
If you refresh your browser, the text should no longer be visible. That is all you need in the css file for this particular exercise. Finally, switch to your js file. In you Javascript file, type the following.

```
var text = document.getElementById("text");

```
Let's explain what you just wrote means.

var is javascript speak for variable. A variable is a container used for storing values. These values can be anything from a string(words or sentences), to integers (whole numbers), or even complex formulas. In this example a varaible is being used to store a dom element (the "text" div) and when ever 'text' is called somewhere in the javascript file, the text div will be what it is refering to.

The "document" part of what you wrote refers to where you are getting what it is you are about to attach to this variable. In this case it is the HTML document.

.getElementById is a javascript method that literally tells javascript what to do. In this case, its saying get the element with the id of "text" which is what is in quotation marks.

Moving on, now you will add a variable that contains the document element with the "reveal" id. Or the id of whatever it is you named the button.

```
var text = document.getElementById("text");
var button = document.getElementById("reveal");

```
Now that are main document or "DOM, which stands for Document Object Model" elements are contained in variables, lets use them to make things happen on the page. Add the following to your current sheet:

```
var text = document.getElementById("text");
var button = document.getElementById("reveal");

button.onclick=function(){
  text.style.display = "inline";
}

```
What you just did was call the .onclick method on the button variable. This tells javascript to do something, in this case call a function, when the button is clicked.

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task when called. In this case, the function is telling the browser to change the style rule for the text element to inline, which in this case would make the text visible. Now if you save the file, refresh your browser and click on the button, It should reveal the text you originally hid. Tada!

#### Practice - Some other things you can do

You can also easily add an alert box by adding the following code:

```
alert("This is an alert box");

```
Now after refreshing the page, the alert box should pop up immediately. It will do this every time you refresh or open the page unless you delete or further manipulate this method. Similar methods that do this include confirm and prompt.

You can also log information to some thing called the javascript console. The Javascript console is a tool used for debugging or finding errors in code. It is also used to test things in javascript. It can be found in Firebug on Firefox and also under other tools in Chrome. To test it out, add the following to your code:

```
console.log("The javascript sheet is attached");

```

Now in Chrome (It is preferable that you use chrome for this exercise), click on the menu options, hover over "more tools", and click on JavaScript console. This should resize your page to make room for the javascript console where the message you typed in you code should appear.

Congratulations! Your well on your way to becoming a programmer.

### Okay, what next?

The only logical next step is to **NOT STOP!** Check out our [learning resources](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/front-end-community/blob/master/first_timers_javascript_guide.md#resources) section and continue your journey. All the best and congratulations!

Remember, even though we did access your page via a web browser, it's not actually on the Internet! For that you would need to
[host](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) your page online. That's an advanced topic that shouldn't worry about right now!
